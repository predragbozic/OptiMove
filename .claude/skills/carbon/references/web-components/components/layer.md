## Overview

The `cds-layer` component is used to render components on different layers. Each
layer has a specific set of token values associated with it. You can use these
tokens directly, or use contextual tokens from our styles package like `$layer`
or `$field`.

The layer component accepts child elements. Each child of a layer component is
rendered using the layer tokens at that layer. Layer components can be nested
indefinitely, but the token sets typically end after 3 layers.

```html
<cds-layer>
  <div>Test component</div>
  <cds-layer>
    <div>Test component</div>
    <cds-layer>
      <div>Test component</div>
    </cds-layer>
  </cds-layer>
</cds-layer>
```

## With Background

The layer component updates layer tokens at each level and theme. When you add
the `with-background` attribute, it automatically sets a background color using
the `$layer-background` token. Without it, you can manually set the background
with `background-color: $layer-background`.

## Setting a custom level

You can override the `level` of a layer if you would like to change the
presentation of a layer in your application. This is particularly helpful if you
would like to reset the layer level back to `0` or if you want to make sure a
part of a page always renders in a certain level.

To do this, you can use the `level` attribute:

## Get the current layer

If you are building a component and would like to know what layer the component
resides within, you can use the `cds-user-layer` custom event.

This event returns a custom event with details of current element, as well as
its layer:

```javascript
document.addEventListener(`cds-use-layer`, (e) => {
  const { layer, level } = (e as any).detail;
  layer.querySelector('.example-layer-test-component.use-layer').innerText =
    `The current layer level is: ${level + 1}`;
});
```
