-- migrations_v2/202611101000_training_load_v60_undo_roster_work.sql
--
-- Not a migration and never run automatically. Rehearsed on disposable databases (backend/tests/session-undo-roster-o1.test.mjs:
-- apply -> rollback -> the v59 catalog exactly (triggers, constraints, columns, every function body) -> re-apply, and every refusal
-- below). Before it is run anywhere real: a fresh restore-verified backup exists; the deployed commit no longer contains the v60
-- migration file (otherwise the migrator applies v60 again at the next start); the deployed backend no longer calls the
-- eight-argument function (the commit before v60 calls v57's six-argument one); and the owner approved this database
-- specifically (.claude/rules/database-safety.md).
--
-- It re-points the five triggers at the original functions (which v60 left in place), puts v57's scope and undo back exactly
-- (checked by md5 afterwards), drops the two columns and every v60 function, and removes the v60 record. It changes no other
-- row. It refuses, changing nothing, when
--   * the migrator is running (advisory lock 822026, taken without waiting);
--   * v60 is not recorded, or any later migrations_v2 migration is;
--   * the body in force of any v60 function is not v60's (by md5);
--   * an import-origin roster request exists (v57 cannot tell it from a coach's work and the column would be lost);
--   * a deletion log row records roster work (the column would be lost: the way back is forward-only).
-- One transaction. Run it at a quiet moment as
